    <p className="mb-4">
      LegalLift is a platform dedicated to providing legal aid to low-income earners in Nigeria. 
      We connect those in need of legal assistance with lawyers willing to offer pro bono services 
      and donors who can help fund legal cases.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Our mission is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their financial status, has access to 
      quality legal representation. We believe that justice should not be a privilege but a right 
      accessible to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Join us in our mission to lift legal barriers and create a more just society for all Nigerians.
